The building was originally constructed as an 'H' plan limestone ashlar building with a slate roof. The building has a \"tall central semicicular archway in a pedimented gatehouse with a clock\" (Listing description).\nThe rear wings of the building were demolished in 1960 when the stables were converted for use as a police station. At this time the entire rear elevation either side of the central archway was rebuilt and now consists of random uncoursed Dolomitic Conglomerate rubble with limestone reveals and lintels.\nAt the time of entry the building remains in office use by the police.\nThe building is Listed Grade II* (Listed Building number 901-1/24/1752)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/historical_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

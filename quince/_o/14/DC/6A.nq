The present house was constructed on the site of an earlier house which, by 1730 was in the ownership of William Reeve. On his bankruptcy the bulk of his estate was purchased by John Estridge. He also purchased additional land in the parish. His son, John, c1780 sold the estate which included Wick House and Broomwell House to Thomas Ireland. The present Wick House was constructed in the late-eighteenth century. The grounds had been landscaped in the Picturesque style. Neale (1823) describes the grounds as \"the Pleasure Grounds, about sixty acres, in which natural advantages have been judiciously improved by art, present a bold inequality of surface, and an association of beauties rarely to be met wth in a similar compass. The little sequestered valley, in which a stream expands into a small lake, in animated by a Rookery, swans and other water fowl. Here the brilliant Kingfisher haunts the recesses of the babbling brook, or glances beneath the arch of the ivy-mantled bridge:- there the Hermitage in the midst of a shady grove, invites to musing and retirement.\"\n In 1792 Ireland sold the estate to Charles Hill, a wealthy merchant from Bristol and in 1820, Wick House was purchased by William Withering from Charles Hill. The Brislington Tithe Award of 1846 records Lydia Withering as the owner and occupier of Wick House. On her death in 1867, the estate was purchased by Daniel Collen (Ireland, 1870: BRO St.LB/HM/1a & 1b). After 1918 most of the grounds were built upon. In 1924 the house and two acres were sold to Walter James who presented the property to the Church of England Children's Society. The house remained a childrens' home until c.1980 when it became a nursing home for the elderly.\nWick House is extant and has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/56/471)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/historical_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

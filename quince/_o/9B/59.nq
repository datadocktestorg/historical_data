The building was a tea warehouse, apparently replacing part of a terrace of early-Georgian houses, which was constructed in c.1832 for Acraman, Bush, Castle and Co. to a design by R. S. Pope. The warehouse was a five-storey structure of coursed Pennant sandstone rubble. The ground-floor was vermiculated Pennant sandstone with a limestone ashlar plat band separating ground- from the upper-floors, and an ashlar cornice. The original structure was of six bays but the warehouse was extended in 1835-1837 when another three bays were added. The building was occupied by James and Robert Bush in the 1880s and by c.1900 a grain elevator had been added to the roof on the west side of the building, with several pipes running from it downwards into the roof to distribute the grain. After the First World War the grain elevator was removed and the building was used to store tobacco in bond.\nBy the early 1970s the building was empty and in 1972 it was acquired jointly by the Arnolfini art gallery and JT Building Group. Between 1973 and 1975 the building was gutted, a new steel frame inserted and offices and gallery space created in the building. A new glazed roof was also added. A substantial refurbishment and reorganisation of the internal space was undertaken between September 2003 and 10 September 2005 when the building reopened.\nIn 1973 a small archaeological excavation inside the building was directed by Roger Price (BUAD 473) and works to the basement in 2004 were also subject to archaeological monitoring (BUAD 4074). Both fieldwork exercises recorded evidence for the shipyard which previously occupied the site.\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/42/190)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/historical_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
